This is Little Smalltalk version 3 for an IBM PC.

The source is by Tim Budd. The document reformatting and makefile
hacking is by Daniel Simmons.  The executables were compiled with
Borland C++.  I took the source code distribution straight from cs.orst.edu,
sent the two documentation files through nroff -a -ms > *.txt, loaded the
text files into Wordperfect and edited them to print nicely on my Oki 390,
hacked the makefile (assumes borland c++ is in the directory c:\cpp, and
turbo c ver. 2.0 is in c:\turboc), and compiled the things.

Everywhere that I modified a file, the old file is present as well with the
same name and the extension ".old"  (That includes this readme file.)  I
seem to have lost the original documentation files, and I'm too lazy to go
ftp them again.  But, everything else should be complete.

To make the source yourself with Borland C++, switch into the directory:
~\src and type "make bc++"  Alternatively, you can type "make ibmturboc" if
you have Turbo C ver. 2.0 or something like that.  If you really want this
to work on some other system, you probably have to edit the files.  I would
recommend getting the stuff straight from the horses mouth at Oregon State.
(ftp cs.orst.edu, directory: pub/budd)

I'm distributing this simply because I was very dissapointed when I got
the little smalltalk from wuarchive in ~\mirrors\msdos\smalltalk and it
wouldn't run on my system.  (I still haven't bothered to take the time and
figure out why.)  This is version 3, which I gather is considerably improved
in the area of portability over version 1 (which I believe is what is at
wuarchive).  So, hopefully this will work for others.

NOTE: This code was put in the public domain by the author Tim Budd.  I
have made no real contribution to the code, and I actually have not used
it much yet.  Send your questions to him (or me, but I probably can't
answer them), or better yet post them on Comp.Lang.Smalltalk.  I make
no guarantee or any of that jazz.  If something goes wrong, you have my
symphathy, but it's your problem.

P.S.  Always a handy piece of information: to exit the little smalltalk
      system, type: ^Z (control-Z which is the DOS end-of-file char).
